validation for seat number on booking

make receipt button look like book button (input vs button elements)

link up bookings for all shows to main booking page (see Macbeth) - add 'action="booking.html"' to form and add seats to options also

consistent colours - make all text white? or less off-coloured instead

accessibility guidelines

something for screenreader on booking if p tags aren't read by screenreader - investigate (regarding phoning if you cant use booking seats)

make footer lighter? idk - matches logo atm
