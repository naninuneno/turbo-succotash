link up bookings for all shows to main booking page (see Macbeth) - add 'action="booking.html"' to form and add seats to options also

real text for About page and footer instead of Lorem Ipsum

form validation on booking

consistent colours - make all text white? or less off-coloured instead

accessibility guidelines

something for screenreader on booking if p tags aren't read by screenreader - investigate (regarding phoning if you cant use booking seats)

make footer lighter? idk - matches logo atm



x fix joke offers or at least fix their alt tags

x able to make carousel vertically scale?

x fix stage div on booking page

x fix titles for each page

x something on booking like 'phone X if you're visually impaired for availability and booking'

x add google maps to contact page so it's less empty

x fix pic sizes on Offers when on huge screen so they're equal
